This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera resolutions. The issue manifests as an inability to capture images or videos at resolutions not explicitly defined in the Camera's supported resolutions list. This often happens when the camera's aspect ratio is not supported by the device's hardware, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The error messages are usually generic and unclear, making debugging challenging.
